My original goal was to become an software engineer, but not much later in life my vision broadened and he became interested in web design and database management.
I've also participated in courses requiring various application programs including computer programming.
In my academic curriculum, I upgraded many marketable skills as part of senior design courses in HTML, CSS, PHP, and C#.


I was well-prepared for the college experience with my heavy emphasis
on the web design and database knowledge.
All that I will gain from this process is to improve my writing

My field of study was Web Designer at Vocational high school. I selected most relevant to this major as soon as I entered Balikesir University in 2021. I enjoyed database and algorithm in high school, and as a result I became involved with a lot projects when I was in 12th grade called. I had the opportunity to present.I really enjoyed the technical and teamwork aspects of this project, I
thought that a career in engineering would be a good fit for me.
Lastly, I enjoy problem solving and love a challenge, and I believed that Software engieer would be a challenging but rewarding  course of study. 



The more that I learned about software engineering and the broad range of career opportunities available to engineers, the more excited I became about my chosen field. I had long-term internship while I was in highschool. In these activities,

I had the opportunity to talk with practicing engineers, see what the business world was like, and assess my skills to determine what the best job fit would be for me. During that internship, I became interested in learning more about engineering management. I was particularly interested in learning about this career path because I saw it
as an opportunity for me to combine my technical degrees with my
interest in leadership and desire to work with people.


I had the opportunity to present. I liked the hands-on aspect of this project, I felt that a career in engineering would be a good fit for me. I also enjoyed the teamwork aspect and with the help of others could complete this project excellently. I believe that working in a career in software engineering will be challenging but enjoyable for me.

I am a student attending the Department of Computer Technology at Balıkesir University. I'm interested in coding. I see the best way to become a development professional is to earn a degree and then participate in user experience research. Coding proficiency will make it possible for me to write extensions of existing code, create scalable. My field of study for the most part is Web Designer in a subtle way. I like to design web and i designed a lot web site but i also want learn something about backend. Particularly, I appreciate its connection to this really major because I kind of am really actually interested in databases and algorithms. So I selected most relevant to this kind of major as soon as I entered Balikesir University in 2021. At the same time, we mostly have been doing some projects on database systems. I specifically had the opportunity to mostly talk with practicing engineers, kind of see what the business world generally was like, and mostly assess my skills to determine what the definitely the best job basically fit would mostly be for me in a actually major way. During that internship, I became definitely interested in learning fairly more about engineering management in a really major way. I mostly was particularly really interested in learning about this career path because I saw it as an opportunity for me to combine my technical degrees with my interest in leadership and desire to work with people. I really enjoy my studies
