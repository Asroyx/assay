My original goal was to become an software engineer, but not much later in life my vision broadened and he became interested in web design and database management.
I've also participated in courses requiring various application programs including computer programming.
In my academic curriculum, I upgraded many marketable skills as part of senior design courses in HTML, CSS, PHP, and C#.
